Just a warning. In the final hours of the project ive been encountering RStudio crashes when opening EDA-Experimentation.Rmd.

Ive left it for now, as ive already copied the important bits over to final_project.Rmd. However i am leaving it in the folder, as it contains useful information and EDA that I would like to come back to later.
