This project was my final submission for the ANU course: Data Science For Biologists. The brief was open, only requiring use of large, messy datasets and analysis/plotting using R.

I am incredibly proud of my final submission And my effort was reflected in the marking, of which a marker had this to say in the final feedback:

_"This is an outstanding project. There's a very clear question, an incredible amount of research and independent work, and some great coding, in answering it. But most of all, I'm impressed with how careful you have been about the model you've built (I'm glad that you learnt this from Dan, who has spent most of his career encouraging people to be more critical of their own niche models). This is best exemplified by the plot of bio8, where the true presence shows two peaks, but the model suggests a big flat peak inbetween them. That you looked carefully at this, and then clearly interpreted this as a major limitation in your model, shows that you are an excellent scientist! The platypus locator is the icing on the cake, and it's awesome that you brought a live demo to the poster session. Your use of R markdown and GitHub are exemplary (well, almost - next time use some commit descriptions too!). Your poster is also great - though I'd argue you could have used about half that much text. Regardless, this is a truly excellent piece of work."_

Although i am unsure if i will remain publicly active on github, I will occasionally check in on this project, so any comments, critisisms or questions are welcome.
Thank you for taking the time to visit the page, and I hope this tool can be of use to you!
